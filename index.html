				I am Junior or Senior (nobody really knows exactly) at UNO. I currently work in the United States Air Force (USAF) and I'm stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
				I work in the 1st Combat Communications Squadron as a 1D7X1B or Cyber Systems Operator. It most relates to a Systems Administrator in the civilian sector.
				I am currently deployed to NATO's Eastern front in Poland in support of the Ukarine Defense Initiative working on a deployed network. As far as school
				goes, I am a BMS Major with a focus in MIS. I hope to graduate in 2 years and start working on certifications in my field.
